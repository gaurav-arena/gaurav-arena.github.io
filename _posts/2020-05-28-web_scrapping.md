#  Web scraping different news websites for Covid-19 headlines. 

## Goal : To scrap news websites to extract relevant important data related to latest Covid-19 headlines, this can further be utilized to supplement any existing dataset or analysis on Covid-19 with the latest news updates on Covid-19.

This project is on web scraping. The data available on the websites are usually unstructured, web scraping helps collect these unstructured data and store them in a structured form. There are different ways to extract data from websites such as online services, APIs or by writing our own code. In this project, we will implement web scraping with python using the BeautifulSoup library.

We are basically scraping three news websites which belong to three different news organizations (CNN, NBC, CNBC) for data related Covid-19 headlines. This additional data extracted by web scraping these news websites can be used for complementing any existing dataset related to Covid-19 to perform better analysis.

Firstly,importing all the necessary libraries:
```python
from datetime import date
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import spacy
import en_core_web_sm
import pandas as pd
```

Collecting all the news website urls:
```python
cnn_url= 'https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-07-07-20-intl/index.html'
nbc_url= "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus"
cnbc_rss_url = "https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000108/device/rss/rss.html"    
```

So before scraping the website it's important to understand their formats:

- As we can see that the CNN website has a date attached to it and they update only the date for each new day and the rest remains same and thus it is a dynamic html website.
- For the CNBC website, we are using the RSS feed from the CNBC website, the RSS feed is basically an XML file.
- The NBC news url doesn't have any date and it's a simple html website.

Collecting the urls, format of the page, tags(under which the headlines are present) and website names for their identification in respective lists:

```python
urls = [cnn_url,nbc_url,cnbc_rss_url]
formats=['html.parser','html.parser','xml']
tags = ['h2','h2','description']
website = ['CNN','NBC','CNBC']
```

For better understanding we will first start by scrapping only the CNN website:


```python
#setting the date format according to the date format used in the cnn url
today = date.today()
d = today.strftime('%m-%d-%y')
print('date =',d)
```

    date = 07-22-20
    

Getting the html for the CNN website: 

```python
html = requests.get(cnn_url).text
```

Creating a soup object using the BeautifulSoup library:
```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
print(soup.title)#printing the title
```

    <title data-rh="true">July 7 coronavirus news</title>
    

To get an idea about context of the headlines in the news we are using the named entity extraction from the Spacy library.

Loading the entity extraction module of Spacy library:
```python
nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()
```

Printing the headlines and the named entity types of the context talked about in the news headlines in the CNN website:
```python
for link in soup.find_all('h2'): #finding all the h2 html tags as the CNN website contains the headlines under this tag
    
    print("Headline : {}".format(link.text))
    for ent in nlp(link.text).ents:
        print("\tText : {}, Entry : {}".format(ent.text,ent.label_))
```
Headlines from the CNN website along with their entity types:

    Headline : What you need to know
    Headline : Study finds coronavirus associated with neurological complications
    Headline : Colombia extends coronavirus lockdown measures
    	Text : Colombia, Entry : GPE
    Headline : Washington state governor blames Southern states reopening early for late Covid-19 test results
    	Text : Washington, Entry : GPE

    Headline : Texas Education Agency says parents have option to choose remote learning for their children
    	Text : Texas Education Agency, Entry : ORG
    

Now we will be collecting headlines for all the websites now.

Crawling through the required web pages through their urls and printing the headlines and named entities associated: 
```python
crawl_len = 0
for url in urls:
    print("Crawling webpage ...{}".format(url))
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content,formats[crawl_len])
    
    for link in soup.find_all(tags[crawl_len]):
        
        if(len(link.text.split(" ")) > 4):
            print("Headline : {}".format(link.text))
            
            entities=[]
            for ent in nlp(link.text).ents:
                print("\tText : {}, Entity : {}".format(ent.text,ent.label_))           
                
                
    crawl_len=crawl_len+1
```

```python
#collecting the data into a dataframe
news_df=pd.DataFrame(news_dict)
```


```python
#viewing the dataframe
pd.set_option('max_colwidth',800)
