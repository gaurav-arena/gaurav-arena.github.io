**Objective:** This notebook is a an attempt to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 on Canada and it's economy over the months by using the datasets produced by the Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada (French: Statistique Canada), formed in 1971, is the Canadian government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. 

We will be basically using three main indicators the GDP, CPI and the working hours and how they have been impacted by the covid-19 to analyze it's impact on the canadian economy. So before starting let's first try to understand what these indicators indicate:

GDP by industry: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by industry is one of the three GDP series produced by the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA) of Statistics Canada. It is also known as the Output based GDP, because it sums the value added (output less intermediate consumption of goods and services) of all industries in Canada. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. More information about this can be obtained from -https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/workshops/2009/ottawa/AC188-Bk4.PDF

CPI: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is not a cost-of-living index. We could compute a cost-of-living index for an individual if we had complete information about that person's taste and spending habits. To do this for a large number of people, let alone the total population of Canada, is impossible. For this reason, regularly published price indexes are based on the fixed-basket concept rather than the cost-of-living concept. More information about this can be obtained from - https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects-start/prices_and_price_indexes/consumer_price_indexes

Workhours by industry: Actual hours worked is the sum of hours actually worked by all employed persons in the reference week. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. It should be noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal adjustment program is a complicated computer program which differentiates between these seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements in a series over a number of years and, on the basis of past movements, estimates appropriate seasonal factors for current data. On an annual basis, the historic series of seasonally adjusted data are revised in light of the most recent information on changes in seasonality. More information about this can be obtained from - https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028901

# Data Wrangling and Data Preparation

As can be seen from the above section that the columns contain the months and the rows have the industries (for the GDP and workhours dataset) or products (for the CPI dataset). But for easier analysis of the data we would like to have the industries/products across the columns of the dataframe and the months across the rows, thus in order to obtain that we will take transpose of the dataframes.


```python
#taking transpose of the gdp dataframe for easier analysis
gdp_t=gdp.transpose()
gdp_t.columns=gdp_t.iloc[0]
gdp_t.drop('North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)',inplace=True,axis=0)
gdp_t.head()

Thus there are no null values.

As we noticed that for the GDP and Workhours dataframes, the numerical columns are of object type but we would like to have them in float/int datatype for better analysis of the data, thus we will convert the datatype of these columns to 'float' from 'object'.

Now we have all the numerical columns in float type.

# Feature Engineering

For better analysis we would like to have a feature which will indicate whether there has been a decrease or increase in the GDP by industry or CPI by product/product group or Working hours by industry. Thus we will create a new feature 'Increased/Decreased Percentage' which will indicate the percentage increase/ decrease in the GDP/Working hours industry wise and CPI product wise.

*Feature Engineering for the GDP dataset:*


```python
#deriving a new feature which will represent the percentage of increase/decrease in GDP 
x=[]
for i in gdp_t.iloc[:,0:]:
    x.append(((gdp_t.loc['Mar-20',i]-gdp_t.loc['Nov-19',i])/gdp_t.loc['Nov-19',i])*100)
    
print(x)
```

The negative values indicate that there has been a net decrease in the GDP from the month of Nov-2019 to Mar-2020, for all the industries listed in the dataset and this decrease in GDP varies across the industries.

So now we have a feature 'Increased/Decreased Percentage' in the dataframe which we can use for better analysis of the GDP trend over the time period.

*Feature Engineering for the CPI dataset:*


```python
#deriving a new feature which will represent the percentage of increase/decrease in CPI 
x=[]
for i in cpi_t.iloc[:,0:]:
    x.append(((cpi_t.loc['Apr-20',i]-cpi_t.loc['Dec-19',i])/cpi_t.loc['Dec-19',i])*100)
    
print(x)
```

    [-0.5131964809384288, 1.382488479262669, -0.20505809979494966, 1.0577705451586632, -2.2035676810073395, -4.472396925227118, -31.483715319662252, 0.6254886630179695, 1.5901060070671353, 1.2352941176470555, 0.7645259938837919, 0.8921933085501774, -18.951358180669615, -1.9575856443719346, 0.6662225183211192]
    

The negative values indicate that there has been a net decrease in the CPI for that particular product/product group from the month of Dec-2019 to Apr-2020 and the positive percentage values indicate a net increase in CPI for those products.


```python
#appending the newly created feature to the dataframe
x=pd.Series(x,name='Increased/Decreased Percentage',index=cpi_t.columns)
cpi_t=cpi_t.append(x,ignore_index=False)

cpi_t.tail()

# Analyzing using visualizations

*Visualizing the GDP by industry:*

Lets first visualize the GDP of the industries for the month of Nov-2019 and Mar-2020 to see how the contribution of the industries to the GDP changed over these months.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.bar(gdp_t.columns,height=gdp_t.loc['Nov-19'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('GDP')
plt.title(' GDP by industry in Nov-2019')

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.bar(gdp_t.columns,height=gdp_t.loc['Mar-20'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('GDP')
plt.title(' GDP by industry in Mar-2020')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_53_0.png)


So as we can see, the GDP contribution by the industries has decreased which probably is the impact of the COVID-19 and the country-wide lockdown imposed for it. Though the GDP industry wise has decreased the share of their contribution compared to other industries have remained more or less the same. To find out which industries have the most and least decrease in their GDP, let's visualize the percentage increase/decrease in GDP industry wise.


```python
#plotting the decrease in GDP by industry
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.bar(x=gdp_t.columns,height=-gdp_t.loc['Increased/Decreased Percentage'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('% Decrease in GDP')
plt.title(' Percentage decrease in GDP by industry ')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_55_0.png)


Thus from the above plot we can observe that the decrease in GDP was highest for the 'Arts, entertainment and recreation' industry (decreased by more than 41.28%), followed by the 'Accomodation and food services' industry (decreased by more than 37.67%), these are the hardest hit industries in terms of GDP. The GDP for the 'Real estate and rental and leasing' (decreased by 0.2%) and the 'Non-durable manfucaturing'(decreased by 0.083%) industries did not decrease much over the months from Nov-2019 to Mar-2020.

*GDP trends of industries over the period of Nov-2019 to Mar-2020:*


```python
#plotting some of the industry and their GDP trend
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.plot(gdp_t.iloc[:-1,30:])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('GDP')
plt.title('GDP trends for Nov-19 to Mar-20 industry wise')
plt.legend(gdp_t.iloc[:-1,28:].columns,loc='lower right')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_58_0.png)



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))

plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.plot(gdp_t['Arts, entertainment and recreation  [71]'].loc[['Nov-19','Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20']])
plt.title('GDP trend for Arts, entertainment and recreation')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('GDP')

plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.plot(gdp_t['Accommodation and food services  [72]'].loc[['Nov-19','Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20']])
plt.title('GDP trend for Accommodation and food services')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('GDP')

plt.subplot(2,2,3)
plt.plot(gdp_t['Non-durable manufacturing industries  [T011]4'].loc[['Nov-19','Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20']])
plt.title('GDP trend for Non-durable manufacturing industries')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('GDP')

plt.subplot(2,2,4)
plt.plot(gdp_t['Real estate and rental and leasing  [53]'].loc[['Nov-19','Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20']])
plt.title('GDP trend for Real estate and rental and leasing')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('GDP')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_59_0.png)


* Thus as we saw before and can also be noted from the above plots that the GDP for industries like 'Arts, entertainment and recreation', Accommodation and food services' have significantly decreased over these months.
* And industries like 'Non-durable manufacturing' and 'Real estate and rental and leasing' which were initially experiencing a steep increase in GDP and would have probably further increased but due to the COVID-19 situation faced a declining rate over the time.

*Visualizing the monthly CPI product/product group wise:*

Now lets visualize the CPI of the product/product groups for the month of Dec-2019 and Apr-2020 to see how the CPI of the products changed over these months.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.bar(cpi_t.columns,height=cpi_t.loc['Dec-19'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Product/Product Group')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.title(' CPI by product for Dec-2019 ')


plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.bar(cpi_t.columns,height=cpi_t.loc['Apr-20'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Product/Product Group')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.title(' CPI by product for Apr-2020 ')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_63_0.png)


So as we can observe that the CPI for certain products have like 'Gasoline' and 'Energy' have significantly decreased which is probably due to the lock-down imposed during these months. To better analyze the change in CPI product wise, let's visualize the percentage change in CPI over these months:


```python
#plotting the change in CPY by product/product group
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.bar(x=cpi_t.columns,height=cpi_t.loc['Increased/Decreased Percentage'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('% Change in CPI')
plt.title(' Percentage Change in CPI by product/product groups ')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_65_0.png)


* Thus from the above plot we can observe that the CPI decreased for some products and there was a significant decrease in CPI for 'Gasoline'(decreased by more than 31.48% ) and 'Energy'(decreased by more than 18.95% ). 
* Whereas the CPI increased for most of the products like 'Food'(inncreased by 1.38%) and 'Recreation, education and reading' (increased by 1.59%).

*CPI trends of products over the months of Dec-2019 to Apr-2020:*


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.plot(cpi_t.iloc[:-1,2:])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.legend(cpi_t.iloc[:,2:].columns,loc='lower left')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_68_0.png)



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.plot(cpi_t['Gasoline'].loc[['Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.title('CPI trend for product : Gasoline')

plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.plot(cpi_t['Energy 7'].loc[['Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.title('CPI trend for product : Energy')

plt.subplot(2,2,3)
plt.plot(cpi_t['Food 5'].loc[['Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.title('CPI trend for product : Food')

plt.subplot(2,2,4)
plt.plot(cpi_t['Recreation, education and reading'].loc[['Dec-19','Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('CPI')
plt.title('CPI trend for product : Recreation, education and reading')

plt.tight_layout()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_69_0.png)


* Thus as we saw before and can also note from the above plots that the CPI for products like 'Gasoline', 'Energy' have significantly decreased over these months.
* And products like 'Food' and 'Recreation, education and reading' has experienced an increase over the time. Though the CPI for 'Recreation, education and reading' seems to be decreasing now but the CPI for 'Food' is still increasing steeply

*Visualizing the working hours by industries:*

Lets now visualize the working hours industry wise for the month of Jan-2020 and May-2020 to see how the working hours of the industries changed over these months:


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.bar(workhours_t.columns,height=workhours_t.loc['Jan-20'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('Workhours')
plt.title(' Workhours by industry for Jan-2020 ')


plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.bar(workhours_t.columns,height=workhours_t.loc['May-20'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('Workhours')
plt.title(' Workhours by industry for May-2020 ')
plt.show()
plt.tight_layout()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_73_0.png)



    <Figure size 432x288 with 0 Axes>


So as we can observe that the workhours for all the listed industries have decreased. To better analyze the decreas in the workhours industry wise, let's visualize the percentage decrease in workhours over these months:


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.bar(x=workhours_t.columns,height=-workhours_t.loc['Increased/Decreased Percentage'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Industry')
plt.ylabel('% Decrease in Workhours')
plt.title('Percentage decrease in workhours industry wise')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_75_0.png)


* Thus from the above plot we can observe that the decrease in workhours was highest for the 'Accomodation and food services' industry (decreased by more than 62.63%), followed by the 'Other services (except public administration)' industry (decreased by more than 40.17%), these are the hardest hit industries in terms of workhours. 
* The workhours for the 'Public Administration' (decreased by 3.62%) and the 'Utilities'(decreased by 4.22%) industries did not decrease much over the months from Jan-2020 to May-2020.

*Workhours trend industry wise over the period of Jan-May 2020:*


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.plot(workhours_t.iloc[:-1,1:19])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Hours')
plt.title('Workhours trend for Jan-20 to May-20 industry wise')
plt.legend(workhours_t.iloc[:,1:].columns,loc='lower right')
plt.show()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_78_0.png)



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.plot(workhours_t['Professional, scientific and technical services'].loc[['Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20','May-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Hours')
plt.title('Workhours trend for Professional, scientific and technical services industry')

plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.plot(workhours_t['Services-producing sector 11'].loc[['Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20','May-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Hours')
plt.title('Workhours trend for Services-producing sector')

plt.subplot(2,2,4)
plt.plot(workhours_t['Public administration'].loc[['Jan-20','Feb-20','Mar-20','Apr-20','May-20']])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Hours')
plt.title('Workhours trend for Public administration')

plt.tight_layout()
```


![png](Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_files/Canada_Covid19_Impact_Analysis_79_0.png)


* Thus as we saw before and can also note from the above plots that the workhours for industries like 'Accomodation and food services' have significantly decreased over these months.
* And products like 'Public administration' and 'Servicing producing sector' has experienced a steep decrease in workhours during the initial phase of this period but now they are slowly increasing over the time and this change can be contributed to the slow reopening of the economy.
